WorSeD is an prototypical open source implementation of Schütze's Word-sense discrimination algorithm.
It was developed in the course of the seminar "Ambiguity and Polysemy" at the Cognitive Science Institute of the University of Osnabrück.
The goal of the project was to show that the algroithm proposed by Schütze can be simplified by using first-order co-occurrence instead of second-order.

The evaluation on a subset of NLTK's Senseval2 corpus was not able to reproduce the discriminative results presented by Schütze. Rather it exhibits an
below-baseline performance. A statistically significant difference in accuracy between both implemented approaches was however not found which backs
the initial claim. This holds only if the implementation can be validated.

The original implementation by Schütze can be found at: **Placeholder**
A paper with detailed analysis and results can be found in the repository.
